**Abstract:** Restrictive Internet laws, such as “fake news” laws, can exert a chilling effect on online dissent. This research investigates why some authoritarian regimes adopt legal instruments to authorise, legitimise, and reinforce broader strategies of online information manipulation, while others do not. I argue that regimes’ approaches to online repression are shaped by the autonomy of opposition parties and civil society. These two distinct sources of domestic opposition generate incentives for repression while constraining executive coercion by influencing the extent to which citizens and international actors demand procedural legitimacy in state actions, thus shaping the form repression takes. Drawing on cross-national panel data and fixed-effects survival analysis, I show that, when confronted with comparable threats from online mobilisation, greater opposition autonomy inhibits nondemocratic governments from using legal instruments to justify online repression, whereas a more open civil society prompts them to do so. This research sheds light on the conditions under which autocracies employ a legal veneer for information control, and contributes to a deeper understanding of authoritarian resilience in the digital age.
