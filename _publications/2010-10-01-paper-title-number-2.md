**Abstract:** Restrictive Internet laws, such as “fake news” legislation, can create a chilling effect on online dissent. This research examines why some authoritarian regimes adopt legal instruments to authorise, legitimise, and reinforce broader strategies of online information manipulation, while others do not. Building on the literature on online repression and political communication in authoritarian regimes, I argue that the primary goal of legalising online control is to induce a chilling effect among the general population and promote widespread self-censorship. Combining original cross-national panel data with fixed-effects survival analysis, I demonstrate that nondemocratic regimes incorporate restrictive laws into their online control toolkit when there is a more vigorous domestic opposition that necessitates legitimising repression, and when sufficient online regulatory capacity makes legal threats entailed by these laws credible, and therefore effective in provoking self-censorship in society. This research sheds light on the conditions under which autocracies employ a legal veneer for information control in the digital age. My work also has significant implications for research on democratic backsliding that focuses on how populists weaponise legal instruments to shape mass attitudes–a topic of timely relevance given that attacks on media freedom are often the very first step in eroding democracy.
