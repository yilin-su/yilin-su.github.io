**Abstract:** Restrictive Internet regulations enforced in nondemocracies, such as “fake news” laws, have been widely criticized by human rights defenders for their repressive potential and the likelihood of inducing self-censorship among the public. However, there is limited empirical evidence on their impact on online opposition. This study examines whether and how opposition figures in nondemocratic contexts adjust their online discourse in response to these laws and adapt to legally mandated accusatory labels that delegitimise their online activities. I argue that restrictive Internet laws serve as signalling institutions that delineate the boundaries of permissible online behaviour and provide procedural justification for state intervention. As a result, opposition actors often refrain from discussing politically sensitive topics and temper their direct criticism of the government. Drawing on an analysis of 8,751 social media posts produced by Singaporean dissidents before and after the law’s introduction, and after their posts were flagged as “fake news,” I employ LLM-assisted k-means clustering for topic modelling and sentiment analysis. The findings demonstrate that government-sponsored labels can indeed produce a chilling effect online, leading opposition channels to participate less in political discussions and to shift their tone in policy commentary to be more neutral and fact-based. This study provides empirically grounded insights into how autocracies update their repressive toolkit to maintain information control in the online space amid technological advancements. It offers a deeper scholarly understanding of authoritarian resilience in the digital age.
