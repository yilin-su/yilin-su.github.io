Thanks for visiting my website! I am a final-year PhD candidate in the [Department of Political Science and School of Public Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/social-historical-sciences/political-science) at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), expecting to graduate in Spring 2026. I am also a [SEAREG Fellow](https://dcid.sanford.duke.edu/seareg-fellows/) at the [Center for International Development](https://dcid.sanford.duke.edu/) at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), and a member of the [Authoritarian Politics Network](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/research-centre/authoritarian-politics-network/oxford-authoritarian-politics-network) at the [DPIR](https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/), [University of Oxford](https://www.ox.ac.uk/). I am currently on the academic job market.

My research focuses on state-led online repression in authoritarian regimes, with a regional focus on East and Southeast Asia. My dissertation investigates the motivations and public opinion effects of legalized approaches to online information control, particularly disinformation laws and the “fake news” labels they authorize. My job market paper, “*Fake News Labels and Public Opinion in Nondemocracies: Evidence from Singapore*”, received the [2025 Best Student Paper Award](https://apsanet.org/membership/organized-sections/organized-section-awards/past-awards/section-18/) from the [APSA Information Technology & Politics Section](https://apsanet.org/membership/organized-sections/section18/) and is currently under revise and resubmit (*R&R*) with [*Comparative Political Studies*](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/cps).

I earned my [MSc in International Public Policy](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/social-historical-sciences/political-science/study/postgraduate-taught/international-public-policy-msc) with distinction from University College London. I hold a BA in Journalism and Communication Studies from the [School of Journalism and Communication](https://xinchuan.muc.edu.cn/) at [Minzu University of China](https://www.muc.edu.cn/), and received the Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award. Before my doctoral studies, I worked in journalism, industry research, marketing & PR. Outside academia, I am a competitive hybrid athlete (SBD: 80/40/85 (205kg Total) | FTP 142W | HM 2:21).
